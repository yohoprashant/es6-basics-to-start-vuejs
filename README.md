# Modules


How do you load a JavaScript variable, function, class and object from one file into another? There was no native way to do it pre-ES6. Using JavaScript modules, we can do it with export and import syntax.


Modules offer two key benefits:
- We can split our JavaScript app up into multiple files
- We can make certain code reusable across projects
- The naming of import is completely independent in default export and we can use any name we like.
